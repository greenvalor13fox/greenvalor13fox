- 👋 Hi, I’m @greenvalor13fox (Green as in plants/trees and nature+Valor in the act of something more than myself)=GreenValor Organization "Veterans helping Veterans". 
13FoxTrout is my MOS identifier in the US Army. The description is (Fire Support Specialist) entry level as our primary job was as a Forward Observer and we have aka names and tags like
FISTer, FIST, F.O, Eyes of Death, the whispererrr .... We and I say we only because of the nature of the beast we were intentionally set up from ground zero to be placed in situation not only
the most rigerous mental, physical and spirited test and training from the start. As the PULSE rating used in MEPS for a 13F Fire support Specialist to qualify is a 1. Rating of 1-5= 5 being the 
worst ex. bad eye vision 5 is blind and 1 is 20/20 and above. I know this isn't who I am but it is my understanding after I ended up retired medically from the Army. A 18 year old studying
Oriental medicine from my uncle in the family 6th generation Acupuncture and herbal medicine background. I broke family plans to join the war efforts because of the Sept.11th Attack.
really joined the army on a rebound because I had this childhood fantasy of being a Hero, GI joe, a Soldier at War. As for picking the job as a Forward Observer... Yep you
probably guessed it right. Tricked by the recruiter but I really shouldn't say tricked as what I didn't know then and what I do know now at age 38, is 2 different prospective and views as I 
used to see it during the time I was in the worst time of my life, worst time meaning everything from mental, physical, and deadliest situations and enviroments hottest, coldest, latest time 
waking up to not doing a job but my duty as if a regular job and that could compare. If i fell asleep in a job worst thing was a shop lifter or customer, patient walks off with something
other than your life and your teams life. Sigh.... anxiety all over again. Feeling that funk just typing it as I do not even know why I am getting so expressive writing about myself.
I usually just end where I start talking about me. Which I say like yea I have mental issues and blah blah Self Sabatoging etc etc I guess to avoid alot built up survivors guilt 
and other things I am suffering from. As I find peace and a little more of myself each time I help my community, veterans and the elderly.  
- 👀 I’m interested in ...finding cures using herbs for cancerous malignant cells, finding new ways to make to innovate and can I say the cool stuff? 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...web design and new media/ learning about coding with html, css and I do wanna say I am a student of life and learning about everything and what it means
and find the purpose to its creation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...right now I would like to collaborate anything related to my classes so I do not fall behind as you can see I spent more time above... then the actual 
reason why I signed up for github. Sigh, please bear with me I am atleast not oblivious to my irrational and im trying to get my foot in the right pace one foot at a time.
- 📫 How to reach me ...reach me by this ?? isn't it. or echong3@art.edu thank you!
